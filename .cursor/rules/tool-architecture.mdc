# Labeeb Tool Architecture (MDC)

This document outlines the architecture and design principles for Labeeb's tool system, emphasizing the unique characteristics and value of tools.

---

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1 Atomicity

- **Single Responsibility:**  
  Each tool must perform a single, well-defined technical function or operation, abstracted from broader business logic.
- **Smallest Executable Unit:**  
  Tools should be designed as the smallest executable units, enabling their reuse and flexible orchestration into more complex capabilities.
- **Independence:**  
  Tools must be strictly independent and self-contained, with minimal dependencies on other tools to ensure modularity and ease of maintenance.

### 1.2 Discoverability

- **Comprehensive Documentation:**  
  Every tool must be thoroughly documented, including its purpose, usage, limitations, and examples.
- **Centralized Registry:**  
  Tools should be easily discoverable through a centralized registry or catalog, enabling efficient selection and integration by Labeeb or other systems.
- **Explicit Interfaces:**  
  Each tool must have explicit, machine-readable input and output specifications, ensuring seamless interoperability and integration.

### 1.3 Reliability

- **Robustness:**  
  Tools must be robust and resilient, gracefully handling errors and exceptions during execution.
- **Clear Error Handling:**  
  Each tool should provide clear, actionable error messages and status codes to facilitate troubleshooting and automation.
- **Comprehensive Testing:**  
  Tools must undergo comprehensive testing (unit, integration, and regression) to ensure consistent, reliable performance across all supported scenarios.

## 2. Additional Tool-Centric Principles

- **Technical Focus:**  
  Tools should focus on the "how" (the technical operation or transformation performed), not the "what" (business outcome), allowing for maximum reuse across different capabilities.
- **Statelessness:**  
  Tools should be stateless wherever possible, with any required state explicitly managed and documented.
- **Curated Library:**  
  The tool library should be curated to avoid redundancy, ensuring each tool has a unique, well-justified purpose.
- **Versioning and Compatibility:**  
  Tools should be versioned and backward-compatible where feasible, supporting safe evolution and upgrades.

| Principle         | Description                                                                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Atomicity         | Single, well-defined function; smallest unit; independent and self-contained                 |
| Discoverability   | Documented; registered; explicit machine-readable interfaces                                 |
| Reliability       | Robust; clear errors; comprehensively tested                                                 |
| Technical Focus   | Focus on technical operation, not business outcome                                           |
| Statelessness     | Stateless by default; explicit state management if needed                                    |
| Curated Library   | No redundancy; unique, justified tools                                                       |
| Versioning        | Versioned and backward-compatible where feasible                                             |
