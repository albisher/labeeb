# Labeeb Agent Architecture (MDC)

This document outlines the architecture and design principles for Labeeb's agent system, optimized for local projects operating across multiple platforms.

## Core Components

### Agent

- Serves as the primary interface for Labeeb's AI capabilities.
- Manages dynamic tool selection and execution.
- Handles context and state management across sessions and platforms.

## Core Principles

### Agent Lifecycle

- Each agent must have a clearly defined lifecycle: initialization, active operation, suspension, and termination.
- Support dynamic loading and unloading of agents to optimize resource usage.
- Make all lifecycle events (start, stop, error, resume) observable for monitoring and debugging.

### Agent Orchestration

- Orchestrate agents using clear coordination mechanisms (task allocation, sequencing, conflict resolution).
- Support both centralized (hierarchical) and decentralized (peer-to-peer) orchestration models.
- Enable agents to hand off tasks, collaborate, and synchronize state as required.

### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Interaction

- Use standardized protocols for agent-to-agent (A2A) communication, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous messaging.
- Support group communication (broadcast, multicast) and direct messaging, with negotiation and feedback mechanisms.

### Agent State and Context Management

- Each agent must manage its own state and context, persisting relevant information across sessions and platforms.
- Maintain modular state boundaries between agent-local and shared/global context.
- Provide mechanisms for state inspection, update, and rollback.

### Modularity and Specialization

- Each agent should encapsulate a specific set of capabilities or responsibilities (high cohesion, loose coupling).
- Agents must be replaceable and upgradable independently.

### Reliability and Robustness

- Handle errors gracefully, with clear error propagation and recovery strategies.
- Support monitoring, logging, and alerting for agent health and interactions.

### Discoverability and Transparency

- Register all agents in a central directory or registry with clear documentation of roles, capabilities, and interfaces.
- Ensure agent interactions and decision logic are transparent and traceable.

# Changelog
- v1.0: Initial conversion to rule-structure-standards format.
