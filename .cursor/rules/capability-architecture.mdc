# Labeeb Capability Architecture (MDC)

This document defines the architecture and design principles for Labeeb's capability system. The rules herein apply strictly to the concept of a "capability"â€”not to tools, agents, or workflows.

---

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1 Composability

- **Atomicity & Reusability:**  
  Each capability must represent a distinct, self-contained business ability or outcome, abstracted from specific processes, roles, or technologies.
- **Building Blocks:**  
  Capabilities should be designed as atomic, reusable components, enabling flexible assembly into more complex, higher-order capabilities or workflows.
- **Loose Coupling & High Cohesion:**  
  Capabilities must be loosely coupled with each other, ensuring changes in one do not adversely impact others, while maintaining high cohesion within each capability.

### 1.2 Discoverability

- **Clear Definition:**  
  Capabilities must be clearly defined in terms of the business outcome or function they enable, independent of implementation details.
- **Explicit Interfaces:**  
  Each capability should include explicit input and output specifications, making its use and integration transparent to other capabilities and systems.
- **Cataloging & Documentation:**  
  All capabilities must be cataloged and documented to ensure they are easily discoverable and understandable within the organization.

### 1.3 Reliability

- **Robustness & Resilience:**  
  Capabilities must be robust and resilient, handling errors gracefully and providing clear, meaningful feedback when issues arise.
- **Independent Validation:**  
  Each capability should be validated and tested independently to ensure it reliably delivers its defined outcome under expected conditions.
- **Continuous Improvement:**  
  Capabilities should be periodically reviewed and improved to maintain alignment with evolving business needs and strategic objectives.

## 2. Additional Capability-Centric Principles

- **Focus on the "What":**  
  Capabilities should focus on the "what" (the business ability delivered), not the "how," "who," or "where," to maintain abstraction and stability even as underlying processes or technologies change.
- **MECE Principle:**  
  The capability map should be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE): each capability is unique, and together they cover the full scope of business needs.
- **Strategic Alignment & Agility:**  
  Capabilities should be continuously evaluated for dependencies and alignment with strategic priorities, supporting agility and adaptability in the architecture.

- Each capability must represent a distinct, self-contained business ability or outcome, abstracted from specific processes, roles, or technologies.
- Design capabilities as atomic, reusable components for flexible assembly into higher-order capabilities or workflows.
- Ensure loose coupling and high cohesion between and within capabilities.
- Clearly define each capability by its business outcome or function, independent of implementation details.
- Specify explicit input and output interfaces for each capability.
- Catalog and document all capabilities for easy discovery and understanding.
- Ensure capabilities are robust and resilient, handling errors gracefully and providing clear feedback.
- Validate and test each capability independently to ensure reliable delivery of its outcome.
- Periodically review and improve capabilities to align with evolving business needs.
- Focus on the "what" (business ability delivered), not the "how," "who," or "where."
- Ensure the capability map is mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE).
- Continuously evaluate capabilities for dependencies and strategic alignment.
