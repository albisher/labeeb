To achieve fast responses for certain robot commands—bypassing the need for full AI model interpretation—you can implement a command shortcut system using regular expressions (regex) or similar pattern-matching techniques. This approach allows the robot to instantly recognize and execute specific, pre-defined commands (like "go to home") without waiting for the AI model's full natural language understanding or reasoning

.
Fast Command Handling with Regex

How it works:

    Define a set of critical or frequent commands (e.g., "go to home", "move mouse", "click", "right click", "write").

    Use regex patterns to match these commands directly in the robot's input processing pipeline.

    If a match is found, execute the corresponding action immediately.

    If no match, pass the input to the AI model for interpretation.

This hybrid approach ensures that routine or safety-critical instructions are handled with minimal latency, while still allowing for flexible, natural language interaction when needed

.
Common Direct Robot Commands

For robots operating across multiple OS environments, typical direct commands that can be reliably matched with regex include:

    go to home

    move mouse to [x, y] (or "move the mouse to the top left corner")

    click / left click

    right click

    double click

    write [text] (or "type [text]")

    open [application/file]

    close [application/window]

    scroll up / scroll down

    take screenshot

    lock screen

    shutdown / restart

    increase/decrease volume

    mute/unmute

    copy / paste / cut

    select all

    minimize / maximize window

    switch window / application

You can expand this list based on your robot's capabilities and OS-specific actions.
Regex Example Patterns

Here are some example regex patterns for fast command recognition:

text
^go to home$
^move (the )?mouse to (\d+),\s*(\d+)$
^click$
^right click$
^double click$
^write (.+)$
^open (.+)$
^close (.+)$
^shutdown$
^restart$

Considerations

    For cross-OS support, ensure that the action mapped to each command is implemented for all supported operating systems.

    Maintain a clear separation between fast-path commands (handled via regex) and complex/natural language commands (handled by the AI model).

    Regularly update the regex list as new commands or requirements emerge.

Summary Table
Command Example	Regex Pattern Example	Typical Action
go to home	^go to home$	Navigate robot to home base
move mouse to 100,200	^move (the )?mouse to (\d+),(\d+)$	Move mouse pointer
click	^click$	Mouse left click
right click	^right click$	Mouse right click
write hello	^write (.+)$	Type "hello"
open calculator	^open (.+)$	Launch Calculator app

This system allows your robot to respond instantly to critical commands, improving user experience and operational safety, while still leveraging AI for more complex instructions

Detailed Explanation: Fast Command Recognition with Regex

Concept:
To make a robot instantly respond to certain commands—without waiting for AI model interpretation—you can use regular expressions (regex) to match and act on predefined command patterns. This is especially useful for repetitive, safety-critical, or OS-level commands where speed and reliability are essential.
How It Works

    Regex Patterns: Define regular expressions for each command you want to recognize instantly.

    Matching: When a user issues a command, the robot checks if the input matches any regex pattern.

    Immediate Execution: If a match is found, the robot executes the associated action directly; otherwise, it sends the input to the AI model for further interpretation.

Advantages

    Speed: No delay from AI model processing for known commands.

    Reliability: Reduces the risk of misinterpretation for critical actions.

    Cross-Platform: Regex-matched commands can be mapped to OS-specific actions for Windows, Linux, or macOS.

Expanded List of Example Commands and Regex Patterns

Here are more detailed examples, including possible regex patterns and explanations:
Command (User Input)	Regex Pattern Example	Action Description
go to home	^go to home$	Move robot to home position
move mouse to 100,200	^move (the )?mouse to (\d+),\s*(\d+)$	Move mouse to coordinates (100,200)
move mouse up 50	^move (the )?mouse up (\d+)$	Move mouse up by 50 pixels
click	^click$	Mouse left click
right click	^right click$	Mouse right click
double click	^double click$	Mouse double click
write hello world	^write (.+)$	Type "hello world"
open calculator	^open (.+)$	Open Calculator app
close window	^close (window	application)$
shutdown	^shutdown$	Shut down system
restart	^restart$	Restart system
lock screen	^lock screen$	Lock the computer
take screenshot	^take screenshot$	Capture screenshot
increase volume	^increase volume$	Raise system volume
decrease volume	^decrease volume$	Lower system volume
mute	^mute$	Mute system audio
unmute	^unmute$	Unmute system audio
copy	^copy$	Copy selected text
paste	^paste$	Paste clipboard content
cut	^cut$	Cut selected text
select all	^select all$	Select all text/content
minimize window	^minimize window$	Minimize current window
maximize window	^maximize window$	Maximize current window
switch window	^switch (window	application)$
scroll up	^scroll up$	Scroll up
scroll down	^scroll down$	Scroll down
Regex Pattern Details

    ^ and $ anchor the pattern to the start and end of the input, ensuring exact matches.

    (\d+) captures one or more digits (for coordinates or amounts).

    (.+) captures any text (for dynamic input like "write [text]" or "open [app]").

    Optional words (like "the") can be matched with (the )?.

Implementation Notes

    You can use Python's re module (or similar in other languages) to compile and match these patterns efficiently

.

For more advanced needs, patterns can be extended to support synonyms or slight variations (e.g., "launch" as an alternative to "open").

Regex can be case-insensitive by adding the appropriate flag (e.g., re.IGNORECASE in Python)

    .

Example in Python

python
import re

command_patterns = [
    (re.compile(r'^go to home$', re.IGNORECASE), lambda: go_home()),
    (re.compile(r'^move (the )?mouse to (\d+),\s*(\d+)$', re.IGNORECASE), lambda x, y: move_mouse(int(x), int(y))),
    (re.compile(r'^click$', re.IGNORECASE), lambda: mouse_click()),
    (re.compile(r'^write (.+)$', re.IGNORECASE), lambda text: type_text(text)),
    # ...add more patterns and actions
]

def process_command(user_input):
    for pattern, action in command_patterns:
        match = pattern.match(user_input)
        if match:
            action(*match.groups())
            return
    # If no pattern matches, send to AI model
    ai_model_interpret(user_input)

Note: Replace go_home, move_mouse, etc., with your actual action functions.
