## Availability of "mireattack py" and Code Auditing

**Clarifying the Tool Name**

There is no package called "mireattack py" in the search results or on major Python repositories. However, there are two prominent Python libraries for working with the MITRE ATT&CK framework:
- `mitreattack-python` (sometimes referred to as `mitreattack`)
- `pyattck`

Both of these libraries allow programmatic interaction with MITRE ATT&CK data, which can be used for various cybersecurity tasks, including code and analytic auditing[1][2][3].

---

## 1. mitreattack-python

**Availability**

- The `mitreattack-python` library is actively maintained and available on GitHub and PyPI[1].
- Installation is straightforward with pip:
  ```
  pip install mitreattack-python
  ```
  Requires Python 3[1].

**Capabilities**

- Provides utilities for reading and querying MITRE ATT&CK STIX 2.0 content.
- Includes modules for working with Navigator layers, exporting to Excel, comparing STIX bundles, and more[1].
- Example scripts (such as `analytic_extractor.py`) are provided for extracting analytics from ATT&CK STIX JSON files[4].

**Auditing Code Using mitreattack-python**

- You can use the library to extract, analyze, and map your detection analytics or code against MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
- The `analytic_extractor.py` script demonstrates how to extract analytics from an ATT&CK STIX file and can serve as a template for auditing your own detection logic or code[4].
- Basic usage:
  ```python
  from mitreattack.stix20 import MitreAttackData

  mitre_attack_data = MitreAttackData(stix_filepath='enterprise-attack.json')
  techniques = mitre_attack_data.get_techniques(remove_revoked_deprecated=True)
  ```
- You can compare your detection rules or code logic against the extracted techniques to identify coverage gaps or overlaps.

## 2. pyattck

**Availability**

- `pyattck` is a lightweight Python framework for accessing MITRE ATT&CK data, available on PyPI and GitHub[2][3].
- Install with:
  ```
  pip install pyattck
  ```

**Capabilities**

- Allows access to all defined actors, malware, mitigations, tactics, techniques, and tools in the MITRE ATT&CK frameworks[2][3].
- Can be used for generating reports, augmenting detection rules, and searching for specific techniques.
- Supports both command-line and programmatic use.

**Auditing Code Using pyattck**

- Instantiate the framework and iterate over techniques to compare with your codebase:
  ```python
  from pyattck import Attck

  attack = Attck()
  for technique in attack.enterprise.techniques:
      print(technique.id, technique.name)
  ```
- You can build logic to map your detection rules or code functions to ATT&CK techniques, helping you audit coverage and identify missing areas[2][3].

## How to Audit Your Code

1. **Install one of the libraries** (`mitreattack-python` or `pyattck`).
2. **Extract MITRE ATT&CK techniques** using the library.
3. **Map your detection code or rules** to the techniques, either by matching keywords, logic, or analytics.
4. **Identify coverage gaps** by comparing your code's mapped techniques to the full set from MITRE ATT&CK.
5. **Use example scripts** like `analytic_extractor.py` as templates for building your own audit tools[4].

---

**In summary:**  
There is no "mireattack py," but both `mitreattack-python` and `pyattck` are robust, available Python libraries for working with MITRE ATT&CK data. You can audit your code by extracting ATT&CK techniques with these libraries and mapping your detection logic to them, leveraging example scripts and documentation for guidance[1][2][4].
