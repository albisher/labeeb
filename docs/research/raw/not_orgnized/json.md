## Best JSON Libraries for Python

Choosing the "best" JSON library for Python depends on your needs—whether you prioritize speed, compatibility, features, or simplicity. Here’s an overview of the top options:

**1. Standard Library: `json`**
- Included with Python by default.
- Reliable, easy to use, and sufficient for most use cases.
- Supports customization and complex object encoding/decoding[5][6][7].
- Not the fastest, but avoids external dependencies.

**2. orjson**
- Widely regarded as the fastest and most correct JSON library for Python.
- Excels at serializing common Python types, including dataclass, datetime, numpy, and UUID instances.
- Strictly compliant with the JSON specification (RFC 8259).
- 10x faster than `json` for encoding and 2x faster for decoding in benchmarks[1][4].
- Actively maintained and well-tested, but does not support PyPy[1].

**3. msgspec**
- Competes with orjson for speed; sometimes even faster, especially for encoding integers.
- Particularly efficient for encoding and decoding with type hints.
- Slightly outperformed by orjson on large lists of floats, but generally the fastest for encoding[2].

**4. ujson (UltraJSON)**
- Focuses on speed; 3x faster than the standard `json` library, but not as fast or correct as orjson[3][4].
- Good drop-in replacement for simple use cases.
- Fewer features for handling complex Python types[3][4].

**5. simplejson**
- External library with additional features and sometimes better performance than the standard `json` library.
- Useful for more complex data or when you need extra features[3].

## Comparison Table

| Library     | Speed         | Features (dataclass, datetime, etc.) | Standards Compliance | Ease of Use | Notes                          |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| json        | Baseline      | Limited                              | High                | Easiest     | Built-in, no dependencies      |
| orjson      | Fastest       | Excellent                            | Highest             | Moderate    | Best for speed & correctness   |
| msgspec     | Fastest       | Good (with type hints)               | High                | Moderate    | Best for type-annotated code   |
| ujson       | Very Fast     | Limited                              | Good                | Easy        | Simple replacement for `json`  |
| simplejson  | Faster than json | Moderate                         | High                | Easy        | Extra features over `json`     |

## Recommendation

- For most projects, the built-in `json` library is sufficient and avoids extra dependencies[5][6][7].
- For maximum speed and correctness, especially with large or complex data, **orjson** is the best choice[1][4].
- If you work with type-annotated data and want top performance, **msgspec** is also excellent[2].
- For a simple speed boost without extra features, **ujson** is a good drop-in replacement[3][4].

**Summary:**  
orjson is generally considered the best JSON library for Python if you need maximum performance and standards compliance, especially for complex or large-scale data processing[1][4]. For type-annotated code, msgspec is also a top contender[2]. For most everyday needs, the standard `json` library remains a solid, reliable choice[5][6][7].
