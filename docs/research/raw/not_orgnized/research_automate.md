## Systematic Workflow for Topic-Based Web Research Automation

To enable a bot (like labeeb) to systematically become more aware of external information on topics you provide (e.g., systems, OS, IoT, threats, MITRE ATT&CK), you can establish a structured process that leverages AI-powered web scraping and data extraction. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

**1. Topic and URL Input**

- You provide a list of topics (e.g., “systems”, “IoT”, “MITRE ATT&CK”) along with corresponding URLs that contain relevant information.

**2. Automated Web Browsing and Content Extraction**

- The bot uses AI-powered web scraping tools to visit each URL, navigate the webpage, and extract the content relevant to the specified topic.
- AI-driven scrapers (such as Crawl4AI, Browse AI, or Diffbot) can intelligently parse complex web layouts, handle JavaScript-heavy pages, and filter out irrelevant content like ads or navigation bars[2][4][7].
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) is employed to understand the semantics of the text, ensuring the extracted data is meaningful and contextually accurate[2].

**3. Data Structuring and Storage**

- The extracted information is processed and organized into structured formats (e.g., Markdown, CSV, or JSON), making it easy to review and use for research or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models[4].
- Each research entry is saved in a dedicated research folder, tagged with the topic, source URL, and the date of extraction for traceability and version control.

**4. Research Summarization and Familiarization**

- The bot can generate concise summaries or detailed notes from the extracted content, highlighting key points, definitions, and actionable insights.
- This process helps the bot (and users) quickly become familiar with new concepts, frameworks, or threat models, such as those found in the MITRE ATT&CK matrix[6][8].

**5. Continuous Learning and Updates**

- The system can be scheduled to revisit URLs or monitor for updates, ensuring the research folder remains current as new information is published or existing content changes[3].
- AI-powered scrapers can adapt to website layout changes, reducing manual maintenance[2].

## Example Workflow

| Step                | Action                                                                                   | Tools/Techniques Used           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Input               | User submits topic and URL                                                              | Manual input or UI              |
| Extraction          | Bot browses URL, extracts relevant content                                              | AI web scraping (Crawl4AI, etc.)|
| Processing          | Parse and clean extracted data, apply NLP for context                                   | NLP, HTML/DOM parsing           |
| Storage             | Save structured data in research folder with date, topic, and source                    | Markdown, CSV, JSON             |
| Summarization       | Generate research notes or summaries for quick familiarization                          | LLMs, summarization algorithms  |
| Update/Monitor      | Periodically re-scrape or monitor for content changes                                   | Scheduler, AI scraper           |
