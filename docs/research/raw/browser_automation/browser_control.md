# Browser Control Research

**PyAutoGUI is the official and default technology for all screenshots, mouse, and keyboard automation in Labeeb. All browser automation workflows should use PyAutoGUI for system-level interactions to ensure cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows).**

## Search Prompt
```
Python implementation for browser automation with Playwright, focusing on:
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Modern protocol support
- State management
- Performance optimization
- Error handling
```

## Key Requirements
1. Cross-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
2. Modern protocol support (CDP, WebSocket)
3. State persistence between commands
4. Error recovery with retries
5. Performance optimization (<1s response time)

## Implementation Considerations
- Use Playwright for modern browser control
- Implement context-aware state management
- Handle cross-platform window focus
- Implement error recovery with exponential backoff
- Use Redis for persistent state storage

## Required Libraries
- Playwright: Modern browser automation
- PyAutoGUI: System-level interactions
- Redis: State persistence
- Logging: Error tracking
- LangChain: State interpretation (optional)

## Example Usage
```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

class BrowserController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.playwright = sync_playwright().start()
        self.browser = None
        self.context = None
        self.page = None
    
    def open_browser(self, browser_type='chromium'):
        self.browser = getattr(self.playwright, browser_type).launch()
        self.context = self.browser.new_context()
        self.page = self.context.new_page()
```

## Expected Behavior
- Fast browser launch (<1s)
- Reliable state management
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Automatic error recovery
- Context-aware command execution
