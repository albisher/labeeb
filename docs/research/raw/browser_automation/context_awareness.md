# Context Awareness in Browser Automation

**PyAutoGUI is the official and default technology for all screenshots, mouse, and keyboard automation in Labeeb. All context-aware automation should use PyAutoGUI for these tasks to ensure cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows).**

# Context Awareness Research

## Search Prompt
```
Python implementation for context-aware browser automation with:
- State tracking across commands
- UI element state management
- Command sequence memory
- Cross-command context preservation
```

## Key Requirements
1. Track browser state between commands
2. Maintain UI element locations
3. Remember last actions
4. Handle context references ("same page", "that browser")
5. Persist context across sessions

## Implementation Considerations
- Use Redis for persistent state storage
- Implement context validation
- Handle context restoration
- Manage UI element state
- Track command history

## Required Libraries
- Redis: State persistence
- LangChain: State interpretation
- Playwright: Browser state tracking
- PyAutoGUI: UI state tracking
- Logging: State change tracking

## Example Usage
```python
class ContextManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_browser = None
        self.active_tab = None
        self.last_action = None
        self.ui_state = {
            'main_bar_loc': None,
            'search_bar_loc': None
        }
    
    def execute_command_sequence(self, commands):
        for cmd in commands:
            if 'same page' in cmd:
                target = self.context.active_tab
            # Parse other context references
```

## Expected Behavior
- Reliable context tracking
- Fast context retrieval
- Accurate state restoration
- Seamless command chaining
- Persistent context storage
