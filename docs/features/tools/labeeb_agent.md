# Labeeb Agent

The Labeeb Agent is the core component of the Labeeb framework, responsible for coordinating platform-specific functionality and processing user commands.

## Overview

The Labeeb Agent provides a unified interface for:
- Platform-specific operations
- Command processing
- Resource management
- System integration

## Features

- Platform-agnostic command processing
- Automatic platform detection and handler initialization
- Resource cleanup and management
- Error handling and logging

## Usage

```python
from app.core.ai.agents.labeeb_agent import LabeebAgent

# Initialize the agent
agent = LabeebAgent()
agent.initialize()

# Process commands
result = agent.process_command("your command here")

# Get agent information
info = agent.get_agent_info()
```

## Architecture

The Labeeb Agent follows a modular architecture:
1. Base Agent class providing core functionality
2. Platform-specific handlers for system integration
3. Command processing pipeline
4. Resource management system

## Dependencies

- Platform Manager for system integration
- Base Agent for core functionality
- Platform-specific handlers for system operations

## Configuration

The agent can be configured through:
- Platform-specific configuration files
- Runtime configuration updates
- Environment variables

## Error Handling

The agent implements comprehensive error handling:
- Platform-specific error detection
- Graceful degradation
- Detailed error reporting
- Recovery mechanisms
